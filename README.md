# Raydium CPMM Integration Tests

## What I tested

I ran all the Raydium CPMM test scripts and everything worked perfectly. Tested these functions:

- **createPool** - created a new wSOL/customToken pool
- **addLiquidity** - added liquidity and got LP tokens back
- **withdrawLiquidity** - withdrew some liquidity to get tokens back
- **lockLiquidity** - locked LP tokens as NFTs (both with and without metadata)
- **swapInput** - swapped exact amount of tokenA for tokenB
- **swapOutput** - swapped tokenA for exact amount of tokenB  
- **collectFees** - collected accumulated fees from locked positions
- **createPoolAndLockLP** - created pool and locked LP in one transaction

All tests passed successfully. The Neon EVM composability libraries work great with Raydium's native Solana programs.

## How it works

You can call Raydium functions directly from Solidity contracts. The cool part is:
- Uses premade accounts for better performance
- Handles Associated Token Accounts automatically
- Returns data directly to your contract
- Built-in slippage protection for swaps

## My ideas for using Raydium instructions

### 1. Smart Liquidity Manager
A contract that automatically manages liquidity across multiple pools. It would monitor prices, move liquidity to more profitable pools, collect fees, and reinvest them. Could use the lock mechanism for time-based yield boosts.

### 2. Cross-DEX Arbitrage Bot
Monitor price differences between Raydium and other DEXs, execute instant arbitrage trades using swapInput/swapOutput, and automatically rebalance portfolio across different tokens.

### 3. DeFi Gaming Platform
Integrate Raydium into games where players stake game tokens as liquidity, game achievements affect LP yields, and locked liquidity NFTs become usable game items.
